You take the rock.

What would you like to do?
You go east.

A place that serves beer.

What would you like to do?
You drop the rock.

A place that serves beer.

A rock is here.

What would you like to do?
You go west.

A library in a castle.

What would you like to do?
You go south.

A clearing in a forest.

What would you like to do?
You go north.

A library in a castle.

What would you like to do?
You can't go north from here.

What would you like to do?
Goodbye for now.
