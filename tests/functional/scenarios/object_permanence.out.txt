You take the rock.
You go east.
A place that serves beer.
You drop the rock.
A place that serves beer.
A rock is here.
You go west.
A library in a castle.
You go east.
A place that serves beer.
A rock is here.
You take the rock.
You go west.
A library in a castle.
You go south.
A clearing in a forest.
You go north.
A library in a castle.
You can't go that way.
Goodbye for now.
